        <img src="https://www.budgetbytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chipotle-Pumpkin-Pasta-V1.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This simple recipe is a favourite in our house. The smokey chipotle flavour works very well with the smoothness of the sauce. Originally taken from budgetbytes.com, I have made a few modifications to the recipes for my family's dietary needs, but the essense of the recipe remains the same.</p>
        <p>Requiring minimal prep, this is a fantastic weeknight meal for family or for company!</p>
