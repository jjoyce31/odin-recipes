        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I use this as a basic baked chicken recipe when another recipe calls for cooked chicken. Works great for everything and is super customizable. Sometimes I use garlic salt or other seasonings, depending on what I'm using it for.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter - 1/4 cup, melted</li>
            <li>Salt - 1 tsp</li>
            <li>Skinless, boneless chicken - 4 Halves</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>reheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly butter a baking dish.</li>
                <li>Stir 1/4 cup melted butter and salt together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Arrange chicken in the baking dish. Brush butter mixture onto the chicken until thoroughly coated, pouring any extra over the chicken.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            </ol>
